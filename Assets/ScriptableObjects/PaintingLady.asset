  - content: 'Thank heavens you are finally reading this!* I''ve been pointing downwards
      for so long my arm has grown quite weary.* I don''t suppose I could bother
      you for a small favor?* My dearest Ludwig, my dog, has run away.*  If you could
      return him to me, I may be of assistance to you.* I saw the clumsy housekeeper
      knock down the Master''s paintings.* I''m rather positive that horrendous fiend
      is misplaced.* I would tell you were it was... but I just can''t seem to remember.*
      Perhaps the sight of my beloved Ludwig would jog my memory. '
