  pages:
  - content: Three barons lived at the top of a tall wooden tower The first was very
      small, but enjoyed life slowly and to the fullest The second was average, indecisive
      and lived minute to minute The third was so tall, and the quickest thinker
      of them all  The barons seldom left home, afraid of the sun The lot of them
      had never learned the notion of fun They lived in total darkness, no light
      at all Passers-by claimed they even spoke to their walls  One day, in came
      a new companion A little black cat with the pride of a lion They cherished
      and loved it and made it their own But soon it grew hungry and thin to the
      bone
  - content: "\u201CIt ran. It ran. The cat ran away.\u201D The third baron screamed,
      on that heinous day They pondered and pondered but urgency grew They had to
      move, go out, it's the least they could do  At the strike of three, the first
      baron left The light grazed his skin and his legs failed the test He stood
      there, frozen, pointing and motionless The other two stood watching and turning
      their hands  The second baron followed suit and got further than the first
      Four steps to be exact, before his legs suddenly burst He stood there,  frozen,
      pointing and motionless The last remaining baron stood quietly turning his
      hand"
  - content: It took all his courage but the third baron ran As much as anyone could
      or anyone can From the first baron, he made it eight steps in fact Only to
      realize he was on a circular track  Three barons lived at the top of a tall
      wooden tower The first was very small, but enjoyed life slowly and to the fullest
      The second was average, indecisive and lived minute to minute The third was
      so tall, and the quickest thinker of them all
